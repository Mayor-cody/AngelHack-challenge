### Lifeform Evolution Algorithm

In this final puzzle, we bring you to Mars. That's right - you're an astronaut now. As part of the expedition, you're required to look for lifeforms on the planet. You pull up your scanner, and scan scan scan. Unexpectedly, your sensor starts picking up things! However, your space budget didn't quite cover scientific equipment and you'll have to make do with its abilities. The sensor scans an area that fits into a 5x5 grid. The scan shows lifeforms (X), and empty spaces (.)
That's strange. Your sensor changes quite rapidly - turns out at each minute new lifeforms appear and existing ones die. After a while, you make the following observation: 
1. At each minute, lifeforms live and die based on the number of lifeforms in the four adjacent tiles. For reference, this is what the adjacent tiles look like (.) based on one lifeform
(X)
 .
.X.
 .
2. A lifeform passes away, and is replaced by an empty space UNLESS there is EXACTLY one lifeform adjacent to it.
3. An empty space becomes filled with a lifeform if exactly ONE or TWO lifeforms are adjacent to it. Otherwise, the lifeform or the empty space remains the same
4. How about the tiles on the edge of the grid? They are considered to have fewer than 4 adjacent tiles, and the missing tiles count as empty space permanently
5. This process happens at every location simultaneously, i.e. you should count the number of adjacent lifeforms or space for each lifeform, and then update the tiles

HQ also says to calculate the lifeform score of that layout. Due to some odd configuration in
your communicator, you'll have to calculate it this way:
`2**(the tile number)`
Consider each from left to right in the top row as tiles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the next row as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... , and the last row is 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

```
.....
.....
X....
.X...

 0  1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14
15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24
```

The lifeform score is thus

```
2**15 (32768) + 2**21 (2097152) = 2129920
```

### Question

Consider the following start state:

XXXX.
X....
X..X.
.X.X.
XX.XX


## Code

```python
def print_layout(layout):
    for row in layout:
        print(''.join(row))
    print()


def calculate_lifeform_score(layout):
    score = 0
    for row in range(5):
        for col in range(5):
            if layout[row][col] == 'X':
                tile_number = row * 5 + col
                score += 2 ** tile_number
    return score


def get_adjacent_lifeforms(layout, row, col):
    lifeforms_count = 0
    for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
        adjacent_row, adjacent_col = row + dx, col + dy
        if 0 <= adjacent_row < 5 and 0 <= adjacent_col < 5 and layout[adjacent_row][adjacent_col] == 'X':
            lifeforms_count += 1
    return lifeforms_count


def next_minute_layout(layout):
    new_layout = [['.'] * 5 for _ in range(5)]
    for row in range(5):
        for col in range(5):
            lifeforms_count = get_adjacent_lifeforms(layout, row, col)
            if layout[row][col] == 'X':
                if lifeforms_count == 1:
                    new_layout[row][col] = 'X'
            else:
                if lifeforms_count in (1, 2):
                    new_layout[row][col] = 'X'
    return new_layout


start_state = [
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', '.'],
    ['X', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['X', '.', '.', 'X', '.'],
    ['.', 'X', '.', 'X', '.'],
    ['X', 'X', '.', 'X', 'X'],
]

print("Start state:")
print_layout(start_state)

encountered_layouts = [start_state]
minute = 1

while True:
    next_layout = next_minute_layout(encountered_layouts[-1])

    if next_layout in encountered_layouts:
        repeated_minute = encountered_layouts.index(next_layout)
        print(
            f"\nRepeated layout: {repeated_minute} minute(s) and {minute} minute(s).")
        break
    else:
        encountered_layouts.append(next_layout)
        minute += 1

lifeform_score = calculate_lifeform_score(encountered_layouts[repeated_minute])
print(f"Lifeform score: {lifeform_score}")



```


What is the lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice?
### Output
```
     print(f"Lifeform score: {lifeform_score}") #Output: 32509983
```

# Lifeform Evolution Algorithm

This algorithm simulates the evolution of a lifeform layout based on the given rules and calculates the lifeform score of the repeated layout.

## Algorithm Steps:

1. **print_layout(layout):**
    - Print the given layout.

2. **calculate_lifeform_score(layout):**
    - Calculate the lifeform score of a layout based on the specified rules.

3. **get_adjacent_lifeforms(layout, row, col):**
    - Count the number of adjacent lifeforms at a given position in the layout.

4. **next_minute_layout(layout):**
    - Generate the layout for the next minute based on the current layout and the rules.

5. **start_state:**
    - Define the starting state of the layout.

6. Print the start state using `print_layout(start_state)`.

7. Initialize a list `encountered_layouts` with the start state.

8. Initialize a variable `minute` to track the number of minutes passed.

9. **While** True:
    - Generate the next layout using `next_minute_layout` function.
    - **If** the next layout is already in `encountered_layouts`:
        - Break the loop.
    - **Else**:
        - Add the next layout to `encountered_layouts` list.
        - Increment the minute counter.

10. Determine the repeated minute by finding the index of the repeated layout in `encountered_layouts` list.

11. Print the repeated layout and the number of minutes passed.

12. Calculate the lifeform score of the repeated layout using `calculate_lifeform_score` function.

13. Print the lifeform score.

This algorithm iteratively generates the layout for each minute until a repeated layout is encountered. It applies the rules to determine the next layout and keeps track of encountered layouts. The lifeform score is calculated based on the specified scoring method for the repeated layout.
