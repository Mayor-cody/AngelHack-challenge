# Marathon Race Algorithm

The following algorithm simulates a marathon race for a group of runners with specific running and resting capabilities. The algorithm computes the distance covered by each runner after a given amount of time and returns the distance of the winning runner at the end of the race.

## Inputs

- `runners`: a list of dictionaries representing each runner in the race. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
  - `name`: a string representing the name of the runner.
  - `speed`: a float representing the running speed of the runner in meters per second.
  - `run_duration`: an integer representing the duration of time the runner can run before needing to rest, in seconds.
  - `rest_duration`: an integer representing the duration of time the runner needs to rest before being able to run again, in seconds.
- `total_time`: an integer representing the total duration of the race, in seconds.

## Output

- `winning_distance`: a float representing the distance covered by the winning runner at the end of the race, in meters.

## Algorithm

1. Create a list `distances` to store the distance covered by each runner at each second of the race, initialized to 0 for all runners.
2. For each second `t` from 1 to `total_time`:
   1. For each runner:
      1. If the runner is currently resting, subtract 1 from their rest duration.
      2. If the runner is currently running, add their speed to their distance covered this second and subtract 1 from their run duration.
      3. If the runner is switching from running to resting or from resting to running, update their current state accordingly.
   2. Find the distance covered by each runner during this second and add it to their cumulative distance in `distances`.
3. Find the winning distance in `distances` and return it.

```python
runners = [
    {'name': 'John', 'speed': 10, 'run_time': 6, 'rest_time': 20},
    {'name': 'James', 'speed': 8, 'run_time': 8, 'rest_time': 25},
    {'name': 'Jenna', 'speed': 12, 'run_time': 5, 'rest_time': 16},
    {'name': 'Josh', 'speed': 7, 'run_time': 7, 'rest_time': 23},
    {'name': 'Jacob', 'speed': 9, 'run_time': 4, 'rest_time': 32},
    {'name': 'Jerry', 'speed': 5, 'run_time': 9, 'rest_time': 18}
]

distances = {}

for runner in runners:
    distance = 0
    time = 0
    while time < 1234:
        if time % (runner['run_time'] + runner['rest_time']) < runner['run_time']:
            distance += runner['speed']
        time += 1
    distances[runner['name']] = distance

winner = max(distances, key=distances.get)
winning_distance = distances[winner]

print(f'The winner is {winner} with a distance of {winning_distance} meters in 1234 seconds.')
```

Output:

```
The winner is Jenna with a distance of 3540 meters in 1234 seconds.
```
